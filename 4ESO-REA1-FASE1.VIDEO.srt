00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,900
“Twenty years from now you will be more
disappointed by the things that you didn’t

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,910
do than by the ones you did do.

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,960
Sail away from your safe harbour.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,830
Explore.

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,700
Dream.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,700
Discover.”

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,700
Mark Twain.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,100
Moving around has become very easy and comfortable.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,210
Back to antiquity, people had to spend weeks,
months or even years before they arrived at

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,760
their destination.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:44,110
At first, only wealthy people could afford
moving around for fun.

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,260
Now travelling has become an exciting challenge
for you and me!

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,380
Are you ready to take off?

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,690
“There is a whole world out there.

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:02,210
Pack your backpack, your best friend and go.”

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,479
Travelling with friends can help extend the
good times.

17
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,010
A hop-on hop-off tour bus ensures you will
see the most popular attractions.

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:18,400
Have you ever heard of museums in the eyes
of teenage visitors?

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,950
There are some awesome trip activities,
and … there may be a theme park.

20
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,500
The costs of things like rooms and transport
can be shared.

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,700
But when a trip isn’t organised well …
people waste time and money

22
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,390
people get nervous
things go wrong.

23
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,460
Avoid things that can go wrong
and plan your trip carefully.

24
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,410
So …, do you want to have an unforgettable
trip?

25
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,929
Moving around is here to help you.
